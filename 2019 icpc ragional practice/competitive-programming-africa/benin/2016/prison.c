/**
 * The solution is to use depth-first search and to discover all the cells that
 * are reachable from the start position. At the end of the search, we check
 * if the destination has been discovered in the search.
 * On the grid shown on the problem statement, rows are numbered from bottom to
 * top, which is not the way that arrays are numbered in C. So we make a little
 * change on row coordinates and number them from top to bottom.
 *
 * Note: the solution was given by the organiser of the contest. I won't cite
 * his name here, but if you are curious enough, you will easily find who I'm
 * talking about.
