/**
 * This problem asks to compute the binomial coefficient nCk with:
 *          n = total number of goals scored by the two teams
 *          k = number of goals scored by the losing team
 * We found the solution in the following thread on stackoverflow:
 * math.stackexchange.com/questions/1159063/how-many-ways-to-reach-a-given-tennis-score.
 *
 * Note: the number of possibilities is equal to the total number of goals
 *       scored if one or both teams score one goal.
