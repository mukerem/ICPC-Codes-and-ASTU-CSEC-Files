/**
 * I found two ways to solve this problem.
 *      1. Use a kind of Eratosthenus sieve to simulate the evolution of the
 *         game.
 *      2. One can notice that the number of times a cell is opened or closed
 *         is the number of divisors of its index. So if the number of divisors
 *         of a cell is even, the cell will be left closed. But if this number
 *         is odd, the cell will be left opened.
 * Only the first solution is implemented here :-)
