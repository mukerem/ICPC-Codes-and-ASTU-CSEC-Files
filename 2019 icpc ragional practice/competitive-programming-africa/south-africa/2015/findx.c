/**
 * The solution implemented here is not the best. It would be better to use
 * a stack to evaluate the expression. Maybe you should implement your own
 * solution. It will be a good exercise.
 *
 * Explaination.
 * We parse the equation one token at a time, starting from the left.
 * The parsing algorithm works as follow:
 *  + At start, we are on the left side of the equation.
 *
 *  + If the current item is an operator (`+` or `-`), it will have effect on
 *    the next item, so we store it in the variable `sign`.
 *
 *  + If the current item is a digit, we add its value to the side we are
 *    currently at.
 *      - The variable `lval` holds the value of the left side.
 *      - The variable `rval` holds the value of the right side.
 *
 *  + If the current item is a letter, we get our variable. We store it in
 *    the variable `var` and we store its sign in the variable 'varsign'.
 *
 *  + If the current item is the equality operator sign `=`, we "switch"
 *    to the right side.
 *
 * When we are done parsing the equation, we compute the value of the variable
 * by computing lval - rval. If the sign of the variable is `-`, we negate val.
 *
 * Note:
 *      When we move from left side to right side, we reset `sign` to `+`.
 *
 * Other variables:
 *      n: as in problem statement.
 *      varside: indicates the side of the equation the variable belongs to.
 *               0 => left side, 1 => right side.
 *      side: indicate at which side of the equation we are.
 *               0 => left side, 1 => right side.
 *      sign: 1 => positive, -1 => negative.
