The samples directory contains sample input and output files that are also in the problem
set and were provided to the contestants during the contest.

The testdata directory contains all testdata as used in the judgings. The time limits
depend on the judging machine, but are in general about twice the slowest (correct) jury
submission. For most problems, the difference between a correct and a slow solution is
very large.

The solutions directory contains jury solutions for all problems in various languages.
Some solutions are wrong or too slow; the filename and a special tag inside the file
indicate this. Some solutions contain explanations or proofs of the solution.
